    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      While I have a long history in STEM, I also have years of coursework in the Liberal Arts. I have maintained a love of writing and reading
      which I believe add to my list of strengths. Growing up, I thought having interests across the academic spectrum could be seen as a weakness; instead, I have found 
      that it grants me a more dynamic outlook and ability to communicate across the aisle.
